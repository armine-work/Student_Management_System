# Student Management System
## 
* Initialize a Python project in PyCharm called Student Management System
* Create a script called main.py
* Create a script that gets the full name, age, and average grade of a student for the current year and average grade for the previous year.
* If the age of the student is less than 18, print the studentâ€™s name, age, and tell that he/she is a Primary School student; otherwise, print that the student is a college student
* Print the average grade of the student for two years. If it is less than 50, tell that the student fails; otherwise, tell that the student passes.
* Do a necessary check on the age.
* Print in a readable and nice format.
