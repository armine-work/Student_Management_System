Student Management System

* Initialize a Python project in PyCharm called Student Management System
* Create a script called main.py
* Create a script that gets the full name, age, and average grade of a student for the current year and average grade for the previous year.
* If the age of the student is less than 18, print the student’s name, age, and tell that he/she is a Primary School student; otherwise, print that the student is a college student
* Print the average grade of the student for two years. If it is less than 50, tell that the student fails; otherwise, tell that the student passes.

Change the code to accept data for more than one student
Add one more input, which asks about inputting a new student or stopping.
 If yes, continue inputting; if no, stop inputting and print all students’ data.
Add one more input that asks about the maximum number of students.
And automatically stop inputting students’ data when it reaches that number.

feature_lists (branch)
Change the code to use list(s) for saving the inserted students data
Use the lists to print the necessary data

Refactor code to use at least two types of data structures for working with data:
For example: Personal data of students as a dictionary, Grades as a tuples

feature-add-email (branch)
With string operation, make better formatting for students’ names, like removing extra spaces, and make capitalized name parts
